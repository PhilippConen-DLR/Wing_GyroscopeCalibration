# Wing_GyroscopeCalibration
The following program calculates the offset (angles) of attached gyroscopes. 

Workflow:
1) Change the time of calibration (default: calibrationTime = 20)
2) Run the program.
3) Enter a number of attached IMUs (1-8).
4) Do not touch or hit the attached IMUs or the surrounding area.
5) Look up the offsets for pitch & roll for each IMU in rest position in the GyroCalibration.csv.
